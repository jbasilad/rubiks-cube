          The Rubik's Cube, a six-sided mechanical puzzle, has captivated the minds of millions since its invention in
          1974 by Hungarian architect and professor ErnÅ‘ Rubik. Initially crafted as a teaching tool to help students
          understand three-dimensional geometry, the cube soon morphed into a global sensation, challenging
          enthusiasts with its complexity and igniting a fervor for problem-solving worldwide.
